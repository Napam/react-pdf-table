# **@ag-media/react-pdf-table**

### This storybook shows examples and configurations for common tables used in PDF documents

The goal of this project is to enable declarative tables with the react-pdf library.

> ⚠ **Warning** ⚠ <br />
> The library is specifically designed for use with **@react-pdf/renderer** and will
> **not work** with other react renderers.

While this library covers the usual table layouts, it's not a complete or bullet-proof solution.
Because not all layouts are 100% achievable with the current react-pdf primitives, the table 
components need to be implemented in react-pdf (**[upvote this issue](https://github.com/diegomura/react-pdf/issues/2343)**). <br />
More details about this library's limitations can be found on the [github repo](https://github.com/ag-media/react-pdf-table#limitations--known-issues).
